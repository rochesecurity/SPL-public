# CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities as a Lookup File
This will download the CISA KEV CSV file and work it into a state that can be used to create a lookup file.  It is then possible to schedule the search so that the lookup file is always updated.  This can be helpful when searching through or joining with other data sources where a CVE ID is present.

# Dependencies 
Install this Add-on - https://apps.splunk.com/app/4146/
